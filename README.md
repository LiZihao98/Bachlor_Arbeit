The code is the foundation for the computational assessment in the undergraduate dissertation titled "Fast Failover Routing with Packet-Header Rewriting on Tree Algorithms." This repository contains all the algorithms that have been implemented. In addition, we also provide the configurations that contain the set of parameters used in the evaluations.
